<li>the EU acquis on justice, freedom and security has been growing significantly, thereby confirming the choice made by the Member States to involve the European Union institutions extensively in policy-making in this area so as to ensure freedom, security and justice to Union citizens,</li>
<li>a majority of Union citizens, according to Eurobarometer periodic surveys, increasingly feel that EU-level actions have an added value compared to those taken solely at a national level and two thirds of citizens support EU-level actions which promote and protect fundamental rights (including children’s rights), as well as the fight against organised crime and terrorism, and only 18% consider that EU-level actions have had no extra benefit,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>whereas the positive factors mentioned above cannot offset:<br><ul>
<li>the persistent legal weakness and complexity of the EU decision-making process, notably in areas such as police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, which lack an appropriate democratic and judicial control at EU level,</li>
<li>the reluctance of a majority of the Member States to strengthen policies linked to fundamental rights and citizens' rights; at the same time it appears increasingly essential to focus not only on cross-border cases, in order to avoid double standards within the same Member State,</li>
<li>the continuing need to further develop and correctly implement the EU common immigration and asylum policy, which is facing delays in relation to the timetable agreed on in the Hague Programme and the European Immigration and Asylum Pact,</li>
<li>the difficulties faced by the Commission in ensuring the timely and correct implementation of much recently adopted Community legislation, together with managing a high volume of correspondence, complaints and a growing infringements case-load,</li>
<li>the need for a more extensive involvement of the European Parliament and national parliaments in assessing the real impact of EU legislation on the ground,</li>
<li>the still underdeveloped network of representatives of civil society and stakeholders in each AFSJ policy; it is worth noting that only recently the Ministers of Justice of the Member States decided to build a network aimed at mutually strengthening their national legislation and the same should be done for the other AFSJ areas,</li>
<li>the fact that, even between EU agencies, cooperation is developing slowly and the situation risks becoming even more complex with the multiplication of other bodies with operational tasks at EU level,</li>
