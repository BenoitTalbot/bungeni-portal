regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and
services (COM(2008)0580 – C6-0333/2008 – COD 2008/0187), voters

to a foreign network when using one's mobile telephone in a border
region. Without crossing the border, inhabitants of such regions can
pick up the signal broadcast by a mobile phone operator in the
neighbouring country and, as a result, pay much higher call, text and
data-transmission charges.</p>

left on their own in the Member State of origin while their parents
migrate for work to another Member State has raised considerable
concern in some Member States in the last two years. While policies
do exist with the aim of improving the living conditions and
education of migrant children who moved with their parents working
abroad, the phenomenon of children left at home on their own has
received little attention. According to the study made by Unicef and
Social Alternatives in Romania, almost 350 000 children in 2008 had
at least one parent who was working abroad, and nearly 126 000 had
both parents working abroad.</p>

that all nations in Europe are on a level playing field and should
not have to be concerned about jobs moving to non-EU countries

trade with the EU bloc then it is imperative that they reciprocate by
playing by the same rules regarding state aid. The current procedures

towards eliminating all export subsidies on its agricultural products
by 2013. However, the EU spent no less than EUR 2.5 billion in export
subsidies for the 2006-2007 period. Although the amount may be
decreasing, it is still much too high. In an international context
characterised by a food crisis and an explosion in agricultural
prices, we should be moving much more quickly towards doing away with
these subsidies, which have a dumping effect that is intolerable for

<p align=""justify"">Efforts to increase attendance at school in the
developing world have had considerable success, but the increase in
the number of pupils in schools has not been matched by an increase
in the number of teachers. In many classrooms in developing
countries, the pupil-to-teacher ratio is often 100:1, or even higher.
Current International Monetary Fund conditions attached to loans to
developing countries place restrictions on public sector spending as
a whole, and also impose a ceiling limit for teachers' wages.
Millions of school children are not getting the education they need
because fiscal rules prevent developing countries from employing
enough teachers.</p>

decreasing, it is still much too high. In an international context

prices, we should be moving much more quickly towards doing away with

languages but which nonetheless often have many speakers living in

Sport and Physical Education. Sport and physical education are
considered to be means to promote education, health, development and
peace. One of the goals of the International Year is to create the
right conditions for more sport-based development programmes and
projects. Several countries, for example Norway, Canada, United
Kingdom and the Netherlands, are active in this field. Sport projects
apparently can contribute to reaching the MDGs, especially on themes
like health, education, gender, environment and peace. They are also
known as 'low-cost, high impact' projects.</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">Is the Council aware of the fact that the UN
stimulates countries and international sports associations to be
active in this field through assisting in capacity building,
recognising the possible contribution of sport to social cohesion,
intercultural dialogues, environmental understanding and
re-integration of children in post-conflict situations and the
contribution of sport education to economic and social development?</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">Does the Council share the opinion that sport and
physical education can contribute to development and to reaching the
MDGs? Is the Council considering promoting sport-based development
programmes and projects? Can the Council stimulate a study on the

organisations and sport organisations on development and sport, the
potential of policy in this field and the possible role for the EU
and/or the Member States and/or NGOs on development and sport?</p>",1993-05-09,draft,,,question

<p align=""justify"">The contract for Wharf 2 of the Port of Piraeus
container terminal (SEMPO) to the Chinese company Cosco is to be
submitted for approval to the Greek Parliament over the next few
days. It has provoked a strong reaction from workers and from a
number of organisations because of the unprecedented tax concessions
being offered by the Greek Government to the Chinese company. Under
the contract, the Chinese company enjoys a number of advantages,
including exemption from stamp duty on all loans to fund the project,
immediate VAT reimbursement — with interest for any delay beyond 60
days —‘indefinite loss carryover for setoff against taxable
profits etc. &lt;QT.END'&lt;/QT.END&gt; At the same time, the Piraeus
Port Organisation, which will be responsible for managing SEMPO Wharf
1, is being faced with considerable outlay for the relocation of
docks and buildings, dredging activities etc.</p>

<p align=""justify"">The European Union has expressly recognised the
importance and usefulness of homeopathic medicines and has regulated
their placing on the market by means of a number of directives, the
most recent of which is Directive 2004/27/EC(1), which amends the
Community code relating to medicinal products for human use
(Directive 2001/83/EC(2)).</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">Italy officially transposed that directive by means
of Decree Law 219/2006, Chapter 2 of which lays down special
provisions applying to homeopathic medicines, including the option,
as required under EC law, to use a simplified procedure to register
some homeopathic medicines (for oral administration/external
use/without therapeutic indications and with a given degree of
dilution).</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">However, Article 17 of Decree Law 219/2006 required
the publication in the Official Gazette, within three months of the
decree law's entry into force, of a specimen registration application
form drawn up by the AIFA (Italian Medicines Agency). Inexplicably,
that form, the contents of which were specified in the transposing
act, has, several years later, still to be published. This situation
constitutes an inadmissible barrier to implementation of the
provisions of Directive 2004/27/EC.</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">Some nine million Italians use homeopathic
medicines, and the failure to publish the above form has, in
practice, made it impossible to place new homeopathic medicines on
the market, thus seriously damaging the interests of both producers
and consumers.</p>

inform the Commission about the latest developments in this
programme, in particular in the aviation sector. The UK authorities
are requiring air carriers to participate in the e-Borders Programme
by providing advance passenger information (API). From the last
quarter of 2009 onwards, for designated routes (which might include
intra-EU flights), carriers will be obliged to provide the UK
authorities with even more data – what is termed ‘other passenger
information’ (OPI), also known as passenger name records (PNR) –
data routinely held in carrier reservation systems, in so far as they
are known to them. 
</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">1.	Does the Commission agree that, as there has been
no decision yet regarding the EU PNR proposal (COM(2007)654), the
request for OPI (PNR) data by the UK is premature? If not, why not?</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">Both Directive 2004/82/EC1 and the EU PNR proposal
are very clear in stating that disclosure of passenger data by air
carriers concerns only ‘international flights’ (i.e. from outside
the EU). The ‘new’ UK plans are not clear at all as to whether or
not they will require ‘intra-EU’ passenger data. This is leading
to great uncertainty for the aviation sector on what it can expect
from EU Member States regarding an obligation to disclose
passenger-related data (API, OPI, PNR, and credit card data, even
though this type of data is no longer part of PNR, and/or departure
control systems (DCS)). 
</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">2.	Would the Commission be willing to look into the
UK situation in greater depth, in particular concerning the
consequences of this programme for the free movement of persons in
the EU? If so, could the Commission inform me about its findings? If
not, why not?</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">Each new disclosure or new type of disclosure
requires investment in a number of areas (system adjustments,
procedural changes, data communication costs) by the aviation sector.
As the economic situation in the aviation sector is currently very
weak, that investment might lead to serious financial problems and/or
bankruptcy.</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">3.	Does the Commission agree that this investment
imposes a disproportionate burden on the aviation sector? If not, why
not?</p>",2009-10-30,draft,,,question

Although it is the language of one of the four ‘big’ Member

among the ‘procedural languages’, but is treated as a lesser
language, as if the Union's 60 million Italians were less important

<p align=""justify"" lang="""">Experience shows that the majority of EU
officials now working in Brussels choose to live in one of the 19
municipalities of the Brussels capital region or on the outskirts of
Brussels. However, particularly in the latter area, which is part of
the Flemish and therefore Dutch-speaking region, a number of problems
arise. There are problems of a social nature (the large presence of
EU officials in some municipalities is inflating rents and property
prices, as a result of which many young Flemish families are forced
to leave their local area), but also problems of language policy.
Many Flemish suburban municipalities have to cope with the problem of
French-speaking Belgian incomers who refuse to recognise the
Dutch-speaking character of the area. The gradual Frenchification of
parts of Flemish Brabant is a significant political problem. In a
number of municipalities (so-called municipalities with facilities)
the original Flemish inhabitants have already become a minority. The
presence of large numbers of EU staff who cannot speak Dutch has
often exacerbated the problems. Not because of any ill will on the
part of these EU officials, but mostly for other reasons such as lack
of information.</p>
<p align=""justify"" lang=""""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"" lang="""">There are ways of tackling these problems.
New or even existing EU officials could be offered incentives to
settle in neighbouring Walloon Brabant. They could also be made aware

encouraged to take the Dutch language courses organised by the
municipalities, and so on.</p>

local authorities are involved and therefore it is not possible to
exercise control in the same way as in relation to their own

<p align=""justify"" lang="""">Under the principles of European governance
providing for less direct administration by the Commission, more
effective controls on results and a better cost-benefit ratio, a
large number of decentralised agencies have been set up. There are 23
at present, and another five are proposed in the Commission's draft
budget for 2005.</p>
<p align=""justify"" lang=""""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"" lang="""">The increasing number of agencies (in 1990
there were only three) has led to much higher levels of expenditure,
as normally entered under heading 3 of the financial perspective
(internal policies) - rising from EUR 96 m in 2000 to an expected EUR
281 m in 2005.</p>
<p align=""justify"" lang=""""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"" lang="""">This has a substantial impact on heading 3
and risks jeopardising the other policies and programmes under that
heading.</p>
<p align=""justify"" lang=""""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"" lang="""">It is therefore essential to ensure the
highest possible levels of transparency and monitoring in respect of
the agencies' expenditure. It is equally vital to operate a carefully
planned personnel policy, taking account of the Staff Regulations and
of the need to ensure a geographical balance of human resources and
maximum effectiveness in achieving the objectives set.</p>
<p align=""justify"" lang=""""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"" lang="""">In view of the above:</p>
<p align=""justify"" lang="""">1. 	What is the Commission's evaluation of
the situation?</p>

ensure that the public and private sectors in the Union can derive
maximum benefit from the work of the agencies?</p>",2005-10-14,draft,,,question

<p align=""justify"" lang="""">According to information it has released,
the European Commission intends to carry out a fundamental review of
the approach to funding for technology and business centres, under
the formal procedure pursuant to Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty. The
administrative rules governing aid measures lay down a time-frame of
up to 18 months for this process. As a result of staff and
organisational changes within the Commission, the full period
available is likely to be used, so that no new funding can be
approved until autumn 2005. Given that this measure will undermine
the national and international competitiveness of SMUs and regions
with poor infrastructure, I should like to put the following
questions to the European Commission:</p>
<p align=""justify"" lang="""">1. 	What arguments had the European
Commission put forward against the German rules and what stage has
