1004,9,12,en,Housing Development Agency Bill,,"<strong>MEMORANDUM ON THE OBJECTS OF THE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AGENCY BILL, 2008</strong><br><br><strong>1. OBJECTS</strong><br><br>1.1 In September 2004, Cabinet approved the Comprehensive Plan for the<br>Development of Sustainable Human Settlements (Comprehensive Plan). In line with<br>the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan, the Housing Development Agency (Agency)<br>will assist provinces and municipalities with the rapid release of land and landed<br>property for housing which will thus fast-track housing delivery.<br>2. The rapid release of well-located land and landed property for integrated housing<br>is one of the cornerstones for the success of the Comprehensive Plan. It is important to<br>note that the creation of integrated communities with convenient access to social and<br>economic opportunities needs well-located suitable land and landed property. The need<br>for a land acquisition programme for housing arises from the realisation that land is a<br>scarce and finite resource and the current population growth of 2.1% will make it<br>difficult for the country to meet housing demands. It has been reported that the urban<br>areas have been and will continue to be adversely affected by the rapid population<br>growth and the scarcity of affordable well located land.<br>3. The Agency will therefore facilitate the acquisition of land and landed property, in<br>a way that supplements the capacities of Government across all spheres. Municipalities<br>will be expected to use their housing sector plans to identify local housing land needs.<br>The Provincial Housing Departments (PHD) will be responsible to coordinate these.<br>The Agency will then identify and acquire the land and landed property on behalf of the<br>PHD and the municipality and facilitate collaboration with other sectors in the<br>development of such land.<br>4. The principal objective of the Agency is, by agreement with municipalities, to<br>acquire, hold, develop and release land for residential and community purposes for the<br>creation of sustainable human settlements.<br>5. The Agency will contract with a municipality for the purposes of acquiring<br>available land which has been identified by a municipality for residential housing or<br>community development.<br>6. This will happen only where a municipality lacks the capacity to acquire, hold, or<br>develop the land for residential or community development and nothing in the Act<br>detracts from the power of a municipality to acquire, hold and develop land in terms of<br>its functions under the Housing Act, 1997 (Act No. 107 of 1997).<br>7. The functions of the Agency include assisting municipalities to complete projects<br>which had not been completed and with the upgrading of informal settlements and to<br>deal with emergency housing solutions.<br>8. The mandate of the Agency must be recorded in writing and must document the<br>operational and performance indicators against which the performance of the Agency is<br>measured.<br>9. The Agency is governed by a Governing Board consisting of two executive<br>members and seven non-executive members.<br>10. The functions and workings of the Board are dealt with fully in clauses 9-22 of the<br>Bill.<br>11. Clause 23 of the Bill deals with the staff of the Agency who will be members of<br>the Government Employees Pension Fund.<br>12. Staff may be transferred or seconded to the Agency from the Public Service<br>subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act.<br>13. In certain circumstances the Minister has powers of intervention if the Agency<br>finds itself in financial difficulties or fails to comply with its obligations (clause 30).<br><br><strong>2. PERSONS CONSULTED</strong><br><br>The Bill was published for public comment in Gazette No. 30346 of 26 October 2007.<br>Comments were received from:<br>• Banking Association of South Africa<br>• Thubelisha Management<br>• Provincial Government of the Western Cape<br>• Department of Water Affairs and Forestry<br>• Servcon<br>• Ekurhuleni Municipality.<br><br>Some of the comments received were incorporated into the Bill.<br><br><strong>3. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS</strong><br><br>The financial implications have not been finalised. The Department of Housing is<br>budgeting for the operational cost of the Agency.<br><br><strong>4. PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE</strong><br><br>4.1 The State LawAdvisers and the Department of Housing are of the opinion that this<br>Bill must be dealt with in accordance with the procedure established by section 76 of the<br>Constitution since it falls within a functional area listed in Schedule 4 to the<br>Constitution, namely ‘‘Housing’’.<br>4.2 The State Law Advisers are of the opinion that it is not necessary to refer this Bill<br>to the National House of Traditional Leaders in terms of section 18(1)(a) of the<br>Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act, 2003 (Act No. 41 of 2003),<br>since it does not contain provisions pertaining to customary law or customs of traditional<br>communities.",2008-01-08,draft,,,bill
