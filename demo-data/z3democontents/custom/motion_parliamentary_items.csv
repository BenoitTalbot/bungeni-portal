<li>whereas the commonly shared belief of political and business leaders and mainstream economists that 'free markets know better' and that the free interplay of market forces guarantees an efficient and effective allocation of resources has been strongly disproved by the financial and economic crisis,</li>
<li>whereas the increasing inequality in the distribution of income and wealth (rising profits and wealth, steep decline of labour's share in national income) in the last 30 years was the major driving force behind the giant growth of investment in financial markets and the creation of asset price bubbles,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
<li>whereas the globalisation, liberalisation and deregulation of financial markets have paved the way for financial innovation (derivatives, hedge funds, private equity, securitisation, structured investment vehicles, etc), which in turn has led to excessive and excessively pro-cyclical leverage, short-term behaviour, imposing untenable targets for high rates of return on enterprises in the context of production and services ('shareholder value orientation'), and fast and widespread contagion of risks; whereas, therefore, both the neo-liberal policies of financial market liberalisation and the short-term orientation of increasing shareholder value at any cost have proved to be entirely bankrupt,</li>
<li>whereas the blame for the crisis lies not only with greedy managers in the financial industry but, equally, with the governments of the US and of nearly all the EU Member States as well as with the EU institutions, all of which have promoted the liberalisation of financial markets, in the EU notably with the EU Financial Market Action Plan and the Lamfalussy package, which were based on 'self-regulation' by the financial sector,</li>
<li>whereas the current crisis underlines the need to combine the economic and political power of the entire world in order to tackle the crisis by means of coordinated fiscal policies and to curb the financial markets; whereas the traditional 'western world', especially the US, Japan and the EU, is no longer able to solve the problems single-handedly; whereas the G20 summit was therefore expected to launch a new world economic order, with an important role for the emerging countries,</li>
