1004,9,12,en,Housing Development Agency Bill,,"<strong>MEMORANDUM ON THE OBJECTS OF THE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AGENCY BILL, 2008</strong><br><br><strong>1. OBJECTS</strong><br><br>1.1 In September 2004, Cabinet approved the Comprehensive Plan for the<br>Development of Sustainable Human Settlements (Comprehensive Plan). In line with<br>the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan, the Housing Development Agency (Agency)<br>will assist provinces and municipalities with the rapid release of land and landed<br>property for housing which will thus fast-track housing delivery.<br>2. The rapid release of well-located land and landed property for integrated housing<br>is one of the cornerstones for the success of the Comprehensive Plan. It is important to<br>note that the creation of integrated communities with convenient access to social and<br>economic opportunities needs well-located suitable land and landed property. The need<br>for a land acquisition programme for housing arises from the realisation that land is a<br>scarce and finite resource and the current population growth of 2.1% will make it<br>difficult for the country to meet housing demands. It has been reported that the urban<br>areas have been and will continue to be adversely affected by the rapid population<br>growth and the scarcity of affordable well located land.<br>3. The Agency will therefore facilitate the acquisition of land and landed property, in<br>a way that supplements the capacities of Government across all spheres. Municipalities<br>will be expected to use their housing sector plans to identify local housing land needs.<br>The Provincial Housing Departments (PHD) will be responsible to coordinate these.<br>The Agency will then identify and acquire the land and landed property on behalf of the<br>PHD and the municipality and facilitate collaboration with other sectors in the<br>development of such land.<br>4. The principal objective of the Agency is, by agreement with municipalities, to<br>acquire, hold, develop and release land for residential and community purposes for the<br>creation of sustainable human settlements.<br>5. The Agency will contract with a municipality for the purposes of acquiring<br>available land which has been identified by a municipality for residential housing or<br>community development.<br>6. This will happen only where a municipality lacks the capacity to acquire, hold, or<br>develop the land for residential or community development and nothing in the Act<br>detracts from the power of a municipality to acquire, hold and develop land in terms of<br>its functions under the Housing Act, 1997 (Act No. 107 of 1997).<br>7. The functions of the Agency include assisting municipalities to complete projects<br>which had not been completed and with the upgrading of informal settlements and to<br>deal with emergency housing solutions.<br>8. The mandate of the Agency must be recorded in writing and must document the<br>operational and performance indicators against which the performance of the Agency is<br>measured.<br>9. The Agency is governed by a Governing Board consisting of two executive<br>members and seven non-executive members.<br>10. The functions and workings of the Board are dealt with fully in clauses 9-22 of the<br>Bill.<br>11. Clause 23 of the Bill deals with the staff of the Agency who will be members of<br>the Government Employees Pension Fund.<br>12. Staff may be transferred or seconded to the Agency from the Public Service<br>subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act.<br>13. In certain circumstances the Minister has powers of intervention if the Agency<br>finds itself in financial difficulties or fails to comply with its obligations (clause 30).<br><br><strong>2. PERSONS CONSULTED</strong><br><br>The Bill was published for public comment in Gazette No. 30346 of 26 October 2007.<br>Comments were received from:<br>• Banking Association of South Africa<br>• Thubelisha Management<br>• Provincial Government of the Western Cape<br>• Department of Water Affairs and Forestry<br>• Servcon<br>• Ekurhuleni Municipality.<br><br>Some of the comments received were incorporated into the Bill.<br><br><strong>3. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS</strong><br><br>The financial implications have not been finalised. The Department of Housing is<br>budgeting for the operational cost of the Agency.<br><br><strong>4. PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE</strong><br><br>4.1 The State LawAdvisers and the Department of Housing are of the opinion that this<br>Bill must be dealt with in accordance with the procedure established by section 76 of the<br>Constitution since it falls within a functional area listed in Schedule 4 to the<br>Constitution, namely ‘‘Housing’’.<br>4.2 The State Law Advisers are of the opinion that it is not necessary to refer this Bill<br>to the National House of Traditional Leaders in terms of section 18(1)(a) of the<br>Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act, 2003 (Act No. 41 of 2003),<br>since it does not contain provisions pertaining to customary law or customs of traditional<br>communities.",2008-01-08,draft,bill

<p align=""justify"">The situation of children of EU migrants that are
left on their own in the Member State of origin while their parents
migrate for work to another Member State has raised considerable
concern in some Member States in the last two years. While policies
do exist with the aim of improving the living conditions and
education of migrant children who moved with their parents working
abroad, the phenomenon of children left at home on their own has
received little attention. According to the study made by Unicef and
Social Alternatives in Romania, almost 350 000 children in 2008 had
at least one parent who was working abroad, and nearly 126 000 had
both parents working abroad.</p>

<p align=""justify"">In this time of economic tumult it is imperative
that all nations in Europe are on a level playing field and should
not have to be concerned about jobs moving to non-EU countries
involved in supplying state aid to ailing firms. If members of the
EEC or EFTA such as Switzerland are to reap benefits of increased
trade with the EU bloc then it is imperative that they reciprocate by
playing by the same rules regarding state aid. The current procedures
for remedies of breach of this are slow and cumbersome and offer no
protection to those currently losing their jobs. How does the
Commission plan to tighten up this area of competition law and ensure
there is a fast and effective procedure for dealing with complaints?</p>",2007-03-12,draft,question

by 2013. However, the EU spent no less than EUR 2.5 billion in export
subsidies for the 2006-2007 period. Although the amount may be
decreasing, it is still much too high. In an international context
characterised by a food crisis and an explosion in agricultural
prices, we should be moving much more quickly towards doing away with
these subsidies, which have a dumping effect that is intolerable for

<p align=""justify"">Efforts to increase attendance at school in the
developing world have had considerable success, but the increase in
the number of pupils in schools has not been matched by an increase
in the number of teachers. In many classrooms in developing
countries, the pupil-to-teacher ratio is often 100:1, or even higher.
Current International Monetary Fund conditions attached to loans to
developing countries place restrictions on public sector spending as
a whole, and also impose a ceiling limit for teachers' wages.
Millions of school children are not getting the education they need
because fiscal rules prevent developing countries from employing
enough teachers.</p>

<p align=""justify"">The November 2008 Washington Summit led to an action
plan for dealing with the financial and economic crisis. Meanwhile,
financial markets and financial institutions remain severely
perturbed and under financial distress. The economic situation
worldwide is deteriorating further as the malaise spreads to other
countries.</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">In this context, delivering on the Washington action
plan is crucial. The April G20 Summit should therefore aim not only
to deliver on short-term measures under the action plan, as expected,
but must also steer towards an international agreement on the actions
to be undertaken in the mid- to longer term, with a detailed
timetable for decision and implementation.</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">It must deliver, in particular, on the following
issues:</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">– short- and long-term steps towards the reduction
of global imbalances,</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">– revision of IMF and World Bank governance,</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">– improving the role of the IMF in ensuring
multilateral surveillance and enhanced resources for the IMF,</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">– review of the scope of financial regulation
worldwide, with special emphasis on institutions, instruments and
markets that are currently unregulated, so as to ensure that all
systemically important institutions are appropriately regulated,</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">– revision of governance of the IASB and
accounting standards,</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">– remuneration and incentive models,</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">– the fight against rising protectionist
tendencies.</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">These and other issues need to be addressed in order
to restore the situation on the financial markets and to avoid
further negative spillover and damage to the fragile economic
situation.</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">Does the Council share these views? What is the
message that the EU will deliver at the G20 Summit in April, in

decreasing, it is still much too high. In an international context

prices, we should be moving much more quickly towards doing away with

geographical relocations and the deadweight effect. The current
proposal for a regulation laying down general provisions
(COM(2004)0492 final) seeks to prevent subsidies being paid for
business relocation during the new programming period. However, this
scheme relates only to the 7-year period during which the subsidised
investment has to remain in a given location. How will it be possible
for the relocation of a business before that period to be taken into

<p align=""justify"">The European Union has expressly recognised the
importance and usefulness of homeopathic medicines and has regulated
their placing on the market by means of a number of directives, the
most recent of which is Directive 2004/27/EC(1), which amends the
Community code relating to medicinal products for human use
(Directive 2001/83/EC(2)).</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">Italy officially transposed that directive by means
of Decree Law 219/2006, Chapter 2 of which lays down special
provisions applying to homeopathic medicines, including the option,
as required under EC law, to use a simplified procedure to register
some homeopathic medicines (for oral administration/external
use/without therapeutic indications and with a given degree of
dilution).</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">However, Article 17 of Decree Law 219/2006 required
the publication in the Official Gazette, within three months of the
decree law's entry into force, of a specimen registration application
form drawn up by the AIFA (Italian Medicines Agency). Inexplicably,
that form, the contents of which were specified in the transposing
act, has, several years later, still to be published. This situation
constitutes an inadmissible barrier to implementation of the
provisions of Directive 2004/27/EC.</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">Some nine million Italians use homeopathic
medicines, and the failure to publish the above form has, in
practice, made it impossible to place new homeopathic medicines on
the market, thus seriously damaging the interests of both producers
and consumers.</p>

<p align=""justify"">Following the decision by the Belgian judiciary to
close its investigation into the German journalist Hans-Martin
Tillack, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) had called
on the Commission and the EU Anti-Fraud Office OLAF to apologise to
Mr Tillack for suspecting him of fraud. Will the Commission and/or
OLAF now issue such an apology? If not, why not?</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">On 13 July 2005 Commissioner Kallas had announced
before the Committee on Budgetary Control that, following the end of
the investigation into Mr Tillack, he would consider whether those
responsible had been guilty of misconduct. Does Commissioner Kallas
now intend to order such an investigation?</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">The IFJ had also called on the Commission to order
an independent investigation into OLAF's behaviour in this matter.
Does the Commission intend to act in response to this appeal?</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">How does the Commission judge the charge made by the
European Court of Human Rights that the accusations against Mr
Tillack were based exclusively on rumours?</p>

former member of the Commission press service, will the Commission
examine the role of the persons who were the hierarchical superiors
of this employee at the time, namely Director-General Jonathan Faull
and Commissioner Schreyer?</p>

</p>
<p align=""justify"">Does the Commission consider that the principle laid
down in the EU regulation governing OLAF — namely that OLAF's
conclusions should be exclusively evidence-based — was respected in

2094,9,556,en,Free mobility of academics throughout EU universities,,"<p align=""justify"">An academic living in my constituency has raised
concerns regarding labour mobility in the European academic job
market? He fears that this already difficult problem will worsen in
the current climate, when debates about the free movement of labour
versus economic nationalism are taking place in many Member States,

<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">The UK traditionally has a very open academic jobs
market, not just for EU nationals but also for academics from all
over the world, and British universities benefit from recruiting top
quality European and non-European academics, whereas the university
sectors in countries such as Spain, France and Italy are largely
closed shops. They are allegedly closed shops, to some degree, even
for their own citizens, since jobs are allegedly rarely or never
advertised in the public domain, and it is alleged that there are
virtually no UK citizens working as academics in these countries
because jobs are not advertised and are effectively ‘reserved’
only for nationals of those states.</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">Can the Commission confirm the legality of the
non-advertisement of academic posts to a wider pan European audience
and whether such permanent academic posts can be reserved solely for
nationals of the Member States in question? Are there any plans to
make these jobs compulsorily advertised at national or EU-wide level?
What EU programmes are there for EU-funded exchanges of academics on
a short term basis, and are any of these postings ever converted into
permanent positions with academic tenure in foreign universities?</p>",2004-02-18,draft,question

<p align=""justify"">In April 2007, I tabled questions concerning the
e-Borders Programme, which has existed in the UK since 2004
(reference: E-2115/07). 
</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">As a follow-up to those questions I would like to
inform the Commission about the latest developments in this
programme, in particular in the aviation sector. The UK authorities
are requiring air carriers to participate in the e-Borders Programme
by providing advance passenger information (API). From the last
quarter of 2009 onwards, for designated routes (which might include
intra-EU flights), carriers will be obliged to provide the UK
authorities with even more data – what is termed ‘other passenger
information’ (OPI), also known as passenger name records (PNR) –
data routinely held in carrier reservation systems, in so far as they
are known to them. 
</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">1.	Does the Commission agree that, as there has been
no decision yet regarding the EU PNR proposal (COM(2007)654), the
request for OPI (PNR) data by the UK is premature? If not, why not?</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">Both Directive 2004/82/EC1 and the EU PNR proposal
are very clear in stating that disclosure of passenger data by air
carriers concerns only ‘international flights’ (i.e. from outside
the EU). The ‘new’ UK plans are not clear at all as to whether or
not they will require ‘intra-EU’ passenger data. This is leading
to great uncertainty for the aviation sector on what it can expect
from EU Member States regarding an obligation to disclose
passenger-related data (API, OPI, PNR, and credit card data, even
though this type of data is no longer part of PNR, and/or departure
control systems (DCS)). 
</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">2.	Would the Commission be willing to look into the
UK situation in greater depth, in particular concerning the
consequences of this programme for the free movement of persons in
the EU? If so, could the Commission inform me about its findings? If
not, why not?</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">Each new disclosure or new type of disclosure
requires investment in a number of areas (system adjustments,
procedural changes, data communication costs) by the aviation sector.
As the economic situation in the aviation sector is currently very
weak, that investment might lead to serious financial problems and/or
bankruptcy.</p>
<p align=""justify""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"">3.	Does the Commission agree that this investment
imposes a disproportionate burden on the aviation sector? If not, why
not?</p>",2009-10-30,draft,question

Although it is the language of one of the four ‘big’ Member

<p align=""justify"" lang="""">Experience shows that the majority of EU
officials now working in Brussels choose to live in one of the 19
municipalities of the Brussels capital region or on the outskirts of
Brussels. However, particularly in the latter area, which is part of
the Flemish and therefore Dutch-speaking region, a number of problems
arise. There are problems of a social nature (the large presence of
EU officials in some municipalities is inflating rents and property
prices, as a result of which many young Flemish families are forced
to leave their local area), but also problems of language policy.
Many Flemish suburban municipalities have to cope with the problem of
French-speaking Belgian incomers who refuse to recognise the
Dutch-speaking character of the area. The gradual Frenchification of
parts of Flemish Brabant is a significant political problem. In a
number of municipalities (so-called municipalities with facilities)
the original Flemish inhabitants have already become a minority. The
presence of large numbers of EU staff who cannot speak Dutch has
often exacerbated the problems. Not because of any ill will on the
part of these EU officials, but mostly for other reasons such as lack
of information.</p>

issues, mainly through initiatives for the general public. By
decision of 28 November 2005, the Commission announced that, on
expiry of the current contract (April 2007), it would not be able to
extend its direct involvement as a member of the EEIG in currently
existing National Information Centres on the EU (including in France

Authorities (VVSG) — in November 2005 concludes from this that the
Commission virtually never regards cooperation between local
authorities as an in-house award of a contract, because a number of
local authorities are involved and therefore it is not possible to
exercise control in the same way as in relation to their own
departments. In taking this view, the Commission goes further than
the Teckal judgment, which refers to similar control. The same
article also states that the Commission has for some considerable

<p align=""justify"" lang="""">The European Commissioner for
multilingualism — Leonard Orban — is to make an official visit to
Italy on 23 March of this year on the occasion of the 50th
anniversary of the signing of the Rome treaties. For the first time
the sole content of a European Commissioner's portfolio is
responsibility for multilingualism — testimony to the increasing
importance attached by the EU to acknowledging and encouraging the
languages spoken in the Member States. Providing the people of Europe
with access to information concerning the EU in their own language is
a crucial step towards the full establishment of European
citizenship. It is to be hoped that the Commission will honour the
commitments it made in its November 2005 Communication (which serves
to promote multilingualism within European society, the economic
sphere and the Commission itself) and that it will set a good
example.</p>

that a Commission representative has been appointed in order to
tackle the challenges of multilingualism, will the Commission say
whether it considers it justifiable that documents intended for all
EU citizens (such as the websites and in particular information
documents, with the sole exception of official announcements and
communications referring to European programmes) should be available
in only two or three languages, thereby restricting access by many
small local bodies to EU funding?</p>

<p align=""justify"" lang="""">The Commission's Directorate-General for
Taxation recently published on its web site the findings of a survey
on company tax compliance costs. It showed that tax obligations
account for extremely high costs, which increase with cross-border
activities and may have an impact on a company's international
operations.</p>
<p align=""justify"" lang=""""><br>
</p>
<p align=""justify"" lang="""">According to the findings of the survey,
costs relating to company tax are high, especially for small and
medium-sized undertakings. The main problems mentioned by businesses
include disparities in tax systems and a lack of information. Many
businesses also consider that taxation has an impact on location
decisions and investments.</p>
