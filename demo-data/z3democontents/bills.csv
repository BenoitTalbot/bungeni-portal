1029	1	39	7	\N	The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Criminal Code to change the<br>reference "female circumcision" to "female genital mutilation" to reflect the actual nature ofthe offence and to alter the scope of responsibility in<br>relation to the offence.<br><br>The Criminal Code, 1960 (Act 29) was amended in 1994 to provide for female circumcision as a second degree felony because of public outcry against the cruel nature ofthe act. Eight years after the commencement of the law it is realized that there are shortcomings that unden11ine its effectiveness. There is therefore the need to amend the law to reflect the actual nature and gravity of female genital mutilation.<br><br>The present law refers to the offence as female circumcision but the World Health Organisation acknowledges that excision and infibulation constitute actual mutilation ofnom1al organs hence the need to change the reference trom "female circumcision" to "female genital mutilation" to reflect the actual nature of the offence. The cun-ent law targets and punishes only practitioners, that is the circumcisers, and not other parties who playa primary role in the commission of the offence.<br><br>The Bill seeks to widen the scope of responsibility in relation to the offence to include not only practitioners but other co-operating paJticipants such as persons who send to or receive at any place any person for the perfomance of female genital mutilation.<br><br>The Bill replaces section 69A ofthe Criminal Code. It provides for the offence<br>offemale genital mutilation. A person convicted of the offence by a court of<br>competent jurisdiction is liable to a tenn of imprisonment of not less than four<br>years.
