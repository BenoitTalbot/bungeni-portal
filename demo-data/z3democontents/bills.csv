1004,9,2,38,12,4,A Bill to establish the Housing Development Agency; to provide for its functions and powers; and to provide for matters connected therewith.,Housing Development Agency Bill,,"<strong>MEMORANDUM ON THE OBJECTS OF THE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AGENCY BILL, 2008</strong><br><br><strong>1. OBJECTS</strong><br><br>1.1 In September 2004, Cabinet approved the Comprehensive Plan for the<br>Development of Sustainable Human Settlements (Comprehensive Plan). In line with<br>the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan, the Housing Development Agency (Agency)<br>will assist provinces and municipalities with the rapid release of land and landed<br>property for housing which will thus fast-track housing delivery.<br>2. The rapid release of well-located land and landed property for integrated housing<br>is one of the cornerstones for the success of the Comprehensive Plan. It is important to<br>note that the creation of integrated communities with convenient access to social and<br>economic opportunities needs well-located suitable land and landed property. The need<br>for a land acquisition programme for housing arises from the realisation that land is a<br>scarce and finite resource and the current population growth of 2.1% will make it<br>difficult for the country to meet housing demands. It has been reported that the urban<br>areas have been and will continue to be adversely affected by the rapid population<br>growth and the scarcity of affordable well located land.<br>3. The Agency will therefore facilitate the acquisition of land and landed property, in<br>a way that supplements the capacities of Government across all spheres. Municipalities<br>will be expected to use their housing sector plans to identify local housing land needs.<br>The Provincial Housing Departments (PHD) will be responsible to coordinate these.<br>The Agency will then identify and acquire the land and landed property on behalf of the<br>PHD and the municipality and facilitate collaboration with other sectors in the<br>development of such land.<br>4. The principal objective of the Agency is, by agreement with municipalities, to<br>acquire, hold, develop and release land for residential and community purposes for the<br>creation of sustainable human settlements.<br>5. The Agency will contract with a municipality for the purposes of acquiring<br>available land which has been identified by a municipality for residential housing or<br>community development.<br>6. This will happen only where a municipality lacks the capacity to acquire, hold, or<br>develop the land for residential or community development and nothing in the Act<br>detracts from the power of a municipality to acquire, hold and develop land in terms of<br>its functions under the Housing Act, 1997 (Act No. 107 of 1997).<br>7. The functions of the Agency include assisting municipalities to complete projects<br>which had not been completed and with the upgrading of informal settlements and to<br>deal with emergency housing solutions.<br>8. The mandate of the Agency must be recorded in writing and must document the<br>operational and performance indicators against which the performance of the Agency is<br>measured.<br>9. The Agency is governed by a Governing Board consisting of two executive<br>members and seven non-executive members.<br>10. The functions and workings of the Board are dealt with fully in clauses 9-22 of the<br>Bill.<br>11. Clause 23 of the Bill deals with the staff of the Agency who will be members of<br>the Government Employees Pension Fund.<br>12. Staff may be transferred or seconded to the Agency from the Public Service<br>subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act.<br>13. In certain circumstances the Minister has powers of intervention if the Agency<br>finds itself in financial difficulties or fails to comply with its obligations (clause 30).<br><br><strong>2. PERSONS CONSULTED</strong><br><br>The Bill was published for public comment in Gazette No. 30346 of 26 October 2007.<br>Comments were received from:<br>• Banking Association of South Africa<br>• Thubelisha Management<br>• Provincial Government of the Western Cape<br>• Department of Water Affairs and Forestry<br>• Servcon<br>• Ekurhuleni Municipality.<br><br>Some of the comments received were incorporated into the Bill.<br><br><strong>3. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS</strong><br><br>The financial implications have not been finalised. The Department of Housing is<br>budgeting for the operational cost of the Agency.<br><br><strong>4. PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE</strong><br><br>4.1 The State LawAdvisers and the Department of Housing are of the opinion that this<br>Bill must be dealt with in accordance with the procedure established by section 76 of the<br>Constitution since it falls within a functional area listed in Schedule 4 to the<br>Constitution, namely ‘‘Housing’’.<br>4.2 The State Law Advisers are of the opinion that it is not necessary to refer this Bill<br>to the National House of Traditional Leaders in terms of section 18(1)(a) of the<br>Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Act, 2003 (Act No. 41 of 2003),<br>since it does not contain provisions pertaining to customary law or customs of traditional<br>communities.",2009-03-03,2008-01-08,billstates.draft

1009,9,1,33,44,9,"This Bill will provide for protection and relief to victims of domestic violence. It wasdiscovered after worldwide research that domestic violence is a serious problem. The United Nations called for global action to end violence against women, in particular hence, the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) which Zimbabwe have signed and ratified. The SADC heads of State or Government on 14 September, 1998 in Mauritius signed an addendum to the 1997 Declaration on Gender and<br>Development on “The Prevention and Eradication of Violence Against Women and Children” and resolved to adopt measures aimed at enacting laws making various forms of violence against women, clearly defined crimes with appropriate penalties in order to prevent and eradicate domestic violence.<br>It is the purpose of this Bill to afford the victims of domestic violence the maximum protection from domestic violence that the law can provide and to introduce measures which seek to ensure that the relevant organs of the State give full effect to the provisions of this Bill.<br>The individual clauses of the Bill provide as follows:<br><br><strong>Clause 1</strong><br>This clause sets out the Bill’s short title.<br><strong><br>Clause 2</strong><br>This clause will define terms that are used elsewhere in the Bill.<br><br><strong>Clause 3</strong><br>This clause seeks to outline the meaning and scope of domestic violence. Under the current common law offences, there is no offence called domestic violence. What has been happening is that once any form of domestic violence is reported to the police, it would be slotted into any of the common law offences of assault common; assault with intent to do grievous bodily<br>harm; indecent assault and many others. This therefore, tended to limit the scope of domestic violence since any other act of domestic violence that failed to fit in the existing common law offences would not be considered as an offence. The phenomenon of domestic violence has for long been conceived primarily as a private family affair to be resolved silently within the four<br>walls of the home. Whereas the privacy of the home and the centrality attribute to intimate relations are valued, privacy and intimacy often provide the opportunity for violence and the justification for non-interference. Thus, it is the purpose of the clause to outline all acts of domestic violence which should be considered as punishable under the law.<br>Thus, this clause seeks to widen the scope of domestic violence to include physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional, verbal and psychological abuse, economic abuse, intimidation, harassment, stalking, damage to property, entry into complainant’s place without consent where the parties do not share the same residence, depriving or hindering the complainant from access<br>to his or her place of residence, depriving the complainant of a reasonable share of the use of the facilities associated with his or her place of residence. Also considered as domestic violence is the abuse derived from any cultural or customary rites or practices that discriminate or degrade women such as forced virginity testing, female genital mutilation, pledging of women and girls<br>for purposes of appeasing spirits, abduction, child marriages, forced marriages, forced wife inheritance and other such practices. The abuse perpetrated on the complainant by virtue of his or her age, physical or mental incapacity is also considered as domestic violence under this<br>clause.<br>This clause goes further to define some of the forms of domestic violence outlined above for the avoidance of doubt.<br><br><strong>Clause 4</strong><br><br>This clause makes it mandatory for every police station to have a section to deal withdomestic violence matters and also places a legal duty on the police to assist a complainant of domestic violence. This clause makes it incumbent on the police to assist the complainant to obtain shelter, medical treatment and in any other way. The police are also supposed to advise the complainant of his or her right to seek relief under this Act or to lodge a criminal complaint.<br>This clause also gives the complainant the right to chose to make a report to or have a statement recorded by a police officer of the same sex as him or her. Every police station is obliged to have a domestic violence section to be manned by officers trained to handle domestic violence cases where it is possible.<br><br><strong>Clause 5</strong><br><br>This clause gives the police the power to arrest forthwith, without a warrant any person reasonably suspected to have committed or who is threatening to commit an act of domestic violence on a complainant. The clause also outlines the factors to be considered by a police officer before effecting the arrest without a warrant. Any person so arrested is to be brought before a magistrate within forty-eight hours.<br><br><strong>Clauses 6 and 7</strong><br><br>These clauses provide for the making of an application for a protection order and the determination thereof. The clause gives the locus standi to make an application for a protection order to a wide variety of persons besides the complainant and these include a person acting with the consent of the complainant, a person having care or custody of the complainant and<br>also a complainant’s representative. The complainant’s representative can make an application only with the leave of the court and does not need the complainant’s consent. This therefore ensures that most if not all cases of domestic violence will be brought to the courts. An application for a protection order can be brought to court outside the ordinary court hours and<br>on any day. Such an application has to be dealt with as soon as possible and the court can call for evidence either orally or by affidavit.<br><br><strong>Clause 8, 9 and 10</strong><br><br>Clauses 8, 9 and 10 provide for the issuing of an interim protection order , a final protection order and the contents thereof respectively. Whilst a protection order is issued after the court has had the opportunity to consider evidence, an interim protection order may be issued on receipt of the application once the court is satisfied that prima facie the respondent has committed, is committing or is threatening to commit an act of domestic violence and it is<br>necessary to immediately issue an order to protect the complainant from serious harm, discomfort or inconvenience as a result of such domestic violence.<br>Whenever a court issues an interim or final protection order it shall also issue a warrant for the arrest of the respondent which shall only be suspended when the respondent complies with the order.
