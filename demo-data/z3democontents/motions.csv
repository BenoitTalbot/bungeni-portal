1037	\N	1001	2006-09-19	\N	\N	Motion on the Ovaherero Genocide Introduced In Namibian Parliament	58	\N	Motion on the Ovaherero Genocide Introduced In the Namibian<br>Parliament By the Honourable Kuaima Riruako<br>Paramount Chief of the Ovaherero People<br>September 19, 2006<br>2<br>HON. SPEAKER, THERE IS ABUNDANCE OF PROOF THAT AFRICA<br>WAS THE CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION, CENTURIES BEFORE THE<br>BIRTH OF CHRIST. THE STORIES OF QUEEN OF SHEBA AND HER<br>VISIT TO KING SOLOMON, WITH AN ORGANIZED ROUTINE AND<br>ALSO THE ARCHITECTURAL WONDERS OF THE PYRAMIDS ARE<br>CLEAR EVIDENCES OF THE HEIGHT TO WHICH AFRICA<br>CIVILIZATION HAD REACHED.<br>FURTHERMORE, THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF AFRICA LIKE<br>THOSE SONGHAI, BENIN, GHANA AND MANY OTHERS WERE<br>HIGHLY ORGANIZED AND EVEN THE ANCIENT UNIVERSITIES<br>LIKE TIMBAKTU EXISTED. AT THIS TIME EUROPE WAS VERY<br>UNDERDEVELOPED AND AMERICA HAD NOT EVEN BEEN<br>DISCOVERED.<br>HON. SPEAKER, DEVELOPMENT OF AFRICA WAS INTERRUPTED<br>SOMETIME AROUND THE 14TH CENTURIES BY THE HEINOUS<br>INSTITUTION OF SLAVERY. SLAVERY ROBBED AFRICA OF HER<br>BEST AND STRONGEST MEN, WOMEN AND CHATTEL, LIKE<br>GOATS AND PIGS TO THE ISLAND OF THE CARIBBEAN, UNITED<br>STATES AND BRAZIL. THE RESULTS OF THEIR WORK AS SLAVES<br>WERE TO ENRICH THE COUNTRIES OF THEIR MASTERS. THOSE<br>COUNTRIES BECAME RICH, AND THE SLAVES, AFRICAN MEN<br>AND WOMEN REMAINED POOR.<br>HON. SPEAKER, HON. MEMBERS, IT IS AGAINST THIS<br>BACKGROUND THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THIS AUGUST<br>HOUSE ON THE ISSUE OF REPARATION. REPARATION SEEKS TO<br>IDENTIFY AND REDRESS THOSE WRONG DOINGS SO THAT THE<br>COUNTRIES AND PEOPLE WHO SUFFERED WILL ENJOY FULL<br>FREEDOM TO CONTINUE THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENT ON MORE<br>EQUAL TERMS.<br>HON. SPEAKER, SIR, IN 1850 WHEN A YOUNG SWEDISH<br>ADVENTURE CHARLES JOHN ANDERSSON FIRST VISITED THE<br>THEN HEREROLAND. HE WAS SHOCKED TO DISCOVER THAT<br>WHAT HE HAS SEEN WAS CONTRARY TO HIS EXPECTATIONS.<br>THE OVAHERERO OR DAMARA AS THEY WERE REFERRED TO AT<br>THE TIME, WERE FAR FROM BEING THE SUBJECTS OF A MIGHTY<br>3<br>AFRICAN KINGDOM. INSTEAD WHEN FIRST CONFRONTED WITH<br>THE OVAHERERO COMMUNITY, WHICH WAS AT THAT STAGE<br>STRONGLY DECENTRALIZED, ANDERSON BELIEVED THAT HE<br>WAS WITNESSING THE DEMISE OF A ONCE GREAT AND MIGHTY<br>COMMUNITY, WHICH FOR WANT OF LEADERSHIP WAS NOW<br>DOOMED TO EXTINCTION<br>THE OVAHERERO WERE UNDOUBTEDLY A GREAT NATION, BUT<br>UNLIKE OTHER COMMUNITIES WHICH BECAME MORE UNITED<br>UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF ONE CHIEF OR KING, THE<br>OVAHERERO PEOPLE DWINDLED INTO ENDLESS NUMBER OF<br>PETTY SOCIETIES UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF VARIOUS CHIEFS.<br>HON. SPEAKER, HON. MEMBERS, THIS WAS THE RESULT OF<br>GERMAN POLICY OF DIVIDE AND RULE, EFFECTIVELY<br>IMPLEMENTED BY MAJOR LETWEIN ON BEHALF OF THE<br>GERMAN KAISER WILLEM II.<br>THEREFORE BEFORE I CONTINUE, ALLOW ME HON.SPEAKER TO<br>PAY HOMAGE AND TRIBUTE TO ALL SONS AND DAUGTHERS<br>WHO FOUGHT AND DIED IN THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE OF<br>THIS COUNTRY SINCE THE 1800 YEARS. IT IS AS A RESULT OF<br>THEIR SUFFERINGS AND THE BLOOD SHED THAT WE TODAY<br>ENJOY FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE. SOME OF US CAN NEVER<br>AND WILL NEVER FORGET THE ATROCITIES AND GENOCIDE<br>COMMITTED AGAINST OUR PEOPLE DURING THE OHAMAKARI<br>BATTLE AND THE OZOMBU ZOVINDIMBA EXTERMINATION<br>ORDER OF GENERAL LOTHAR VON TROTHA. WE WILL ALSO<br>NEVER FORGET THE BRUTAL KILLING OF OUR PEOPLE AT<br>PLACES LIKE CASSINGA, AND SHATOTUA AT THE HANDS OF<br>THE RACIST APARTHEID SOUTH AFRICA.<br>HON. SPEAKER, SIR, AND THE FIRST GERMANS WHOLE SALE<br>KILLING OF THE 19TH CENTURY WAS COMMITTED ON THE<br>PEOPLE OF A COUNTRY WE NOW CALL NAMIBIA. WE ARE THE<br>SURVIVORS OF THE FIRST GENOCIDE EVER COMMITTED IN<br>AFRICA,<br>THE OVAHERERO WAS THE ONLY GROUP SINGLED OUT TO BE<br>EXTERMINATED BY AN OFFICIAL LEGAL ORDER THE INFAMOUS<br>EXTERMINATION ORDER, HOWEVER WE ACKNOWLEDGED<br>4<br>THAT OTHER GROUPS SUCH AS THE DAMARAS AND NAMAS<br>WERE HEAVILY AFFECTED BY THE GERMAN COLONIALISM.<br>HON.SPEAKER IN 1880’S THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES STARTED<br>TO CONTROL A SMALL PART OF NAMIBIA, BUT BY 1890, TEN<br>YEARS LATER, THEY SPREAD FURTHER. THE GERMAN<br>SETTLERS TOOK MORE AND MORE LAND AND CATTLE FROM<br>THE OVAHERERO.<br>HON. SPEAKER, SIR, LARGE PIECE OF LAND WAS TAKEN BY THE<br>GERMANS AND REMAINED FENCED TO THIS DAY. IT IS A WELL<br>KNOWN FACT THAT CATTLE ARE A NECESSITY IN THE LIFE OF<br>THE OVAHERERO, FOR OVAHERERO WITHOUT CATTLE AND<br>LAND COULD HARDLY SURVIVE. THE GERMAN COLONIAL RULE<br>WAS OPPRESSIVE AND CRUEL. THE SITUATION BECAME SO<br>INTOLERABLE THAT ON 12TH JANUARY 1904 THE OVAHERERO<br>UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF SAMUEL MAHARERO, TOOK UP<br>ARMS AND THE FIRST OVAHERERO-GERMAN WAR STARTED IN<br>OKAHANDJA AND SPREAD TO OKANDJIRA AND EVENTUALLY<br>CULMINATED IN THE OHAMAKARI BATTLE. STILL THE<br>GERMANS WERE NOT SATISFIED AND ON 2ND OCTOBER 1904<br>GENERAL LOTHAR VON TROTHA ISSUED HIS INFAMOUS<br>EXTERMINATION ORDER AT OZOMBU ZOVINDIMBA IN THE<br>OTJINENE CONSTITUENCY, OMAHEKE REGION. HON. SPEAKER, I<br>WOULD LIKE TO QUOTE THIS ORDER: “I THE GREAT GENERAL<br>OF THE GERMAN TROOPS SEND THIS LETTER TO THE HERERO<br>PEOPLE, HEREROS ARE NO LONGER GERMAN SUBJECTS. ALL<br>HEREROS MUST LEAVE THE LAND. IF THE PEOPLE DO NOT<br>WANT THIS THEN I WILL FORCE THEM TO DO SO WITH A GREAT<br>GUN. ANY HERERO FOUND WITHIN THE GERMAN BORDERS<br>WITH OR WITHOUT A GUN, WITH OR WITHOUT CATTLE, WILL BE<br>SHOT. I SHALL NO LONGER RECEIVE ANY WOMEN AND<br>CHILDREN. I WILL DRIVE THEM BACK TO THEIR PEOPLE OR I<br>WILL SHOOT THEM. THIS IS MY DECISION FOR THE HERERO<br>PEOPLE” SIGNED THE GREAT GENERAL OF THE MIGHTY KAISER<br>WILLEM II.<br>HON. SPEAKER, HON. MEMBERS, ALLOW ME TO HIGHLIGHT THE<br>ISSUE OF GENOCIDE AND REPARATION. I WOULD LIKE TO SPELL<br>OUT WHAT THESE ARE. THE UNITED NATIONS DEFINES<br>GENOCIDE AS “THE DELIBERATE AND SYSTEMATIC<br>5<br>DESTRUCTION OF A RACIAL, ETHNICAL, POLITICAL OR<br>CULTURAL GROUP, IN WHOLE OR IN PART. IT IS THE ACT OF<br>KILLING MEMBERS OF A GROUP IN WHOLE OR IN PART. THE<br>GERMAN EXTERMINATION ORDER WAS INTENDED TO WIPE<br>OUT THE WHOLE OVAHERERO ETHNIC GROUP AND WHEN IT<br>WAS IMPLEMENTED IT REDUCED THE OVAHERERO FROM<br>100,000 TO A MERE 15,000.<br>REPARATION IS THE ACT OF REPAIRING A WRONG OR AN<br>INJURY TO A PERSON OR NATION. WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE<br>PRINCIPLE OF REPARATION. IF YOU BREAK SOMETHING THAT<br>BELONGS TO SOMEONE ELSE YOU MUST REPAIR IT. IF YOU<br>STEAL SOMETHING YOU GIVE IT BACK.<br>HON. SPEAKER, HON. MEMBERS, I HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THESE<br>TWO ISSUES AND THE UNDERLYING THEMES THAT WE<br>EMPHASIZE ARE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE ATROCITIES,<br>RESPECT AND SELF RESPECT FOR THE SURVIVORS,<br>RECLAIMING OUR MEMORIES, NARRATING OUR STORIES AND<br>RECLAIMING WHAT IS OURS. THAT IS WHAT REPARATION IS<br>ALL ABOUT.<br>SOME OF US TEND TO THINK THAT ONLY THE DEAD ARE<br>VICTIMS, WHEN CHILDREN LOOSE PARENTS, THAT LOSS IS NOT<br>ONLY FELT BY THE FAMILY AND COMMUNITY BUT ALSO BY<br>THE GENERATIONS TO COME. WHEN PEOPLE ARE DISPLACED,<br>THEY LOOSE SENSE OF SECURITY AND BELONGING. THEY<br>EXPERIENCE FEAR AND ANXIETY AND LOOSE HOPE FOR THE<br>FUTURE. AS S RESULT THEY ARE DEPRIVED OF KNOWLEDGE,<br>GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS WHICH COULD HELP THEM TO BUILD<br>THE FUTURE AND WEALTH OF THEIR FAMILIES AND<br>COMMUNITIES.<br>HON. SPEAKER, SIR, WE ALL STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF<br>THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE US ; PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES AND<br>ACCOMPLISHMENTS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, THEIR WEALTH<br>HAS BEEN STOLEN AND WE HAVE LESS OR NOTHING TO STAND<br>ON. THEY HAD NOTHING TO LEAVE FOR THEIR LEGACY, AND<br>WE THEIR HEIRS HAVE LESS TO BUILD ON FOR OUR CHILDREN<br>AND THE GENERATION TO COME.<br>6<br>IT IS ON THAT BASIS, HON. SPEAKER, AND HON. MEMBERS THAT<br>I ON BEHALF OF MY PEOPLE, THE OVAHERERO HAVE<br>LAUNCHED A LEGAL CHALLENGE IN THE COURTS IN THE<br>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, DEMANDING AND CLAIMING<br>REPARATION FROM THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT FOR THE<br>ATROCITIES AND GENOCIDE COMMITTED AGAINST OUR<br>FOREFATHERS AND MOTHERS.<br>THE BASIS FOR THE DEMAND FOR REPARATION IS BASED ON:<br>1) THE WHOLE EXPROPRIATION OF VAST TRACT OF LAND<br>OWNED AND OCCUPIED COMMUNALLY BY OUR ANCESTORS.<br>2) THE ILLEGAL EXPROPRIATION WITHOUT ANY<br>COMPENSATION OF LAND AND OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF<br>CATTLE BELONGING TO OUR PEOPLE.<br>3) THE PREMEDITATED EXTERMINATION OF CLOSE TO 80% OF<br>THE OVAHERERO, 2/3 KILLINGS OF THE NAMA PEOPLE AND<br>POPULATION IN PURSUIT OF OFFICIAL GERMAN COLONIAL<br>POLICIES.<br>4) THE INTERNATIONAL DESTRUCTION OF CULTURE,<br>TRADITIONS AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION AND INDIGENOUS<br>GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE OF THE OVAHERERO PEOPLE.<br>(AGAIN NOT CLEAR)<br>5) THE OFFICIALLY SANCTIONED PHYSICAL, SEXUAL AND<br>MENTAL ABUSE OF THE OVAHERERO WOMEN BY GERMAN<br>SOLDIERS AND OFFICIALS, RESULTING NOT ONLY IN<br>UNPLANNED AND UNWANTED PREGNANCIES, BUT ALSO<br>CAUSING SERIOUS MARITAL PROBLEMS FOR OUR FORE<br>FATHERS AND FORE MOTHERS. HUNDREDS OF OVAHERERO<br>CHILDREN BORN OUT OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS HAD TO GROW<br>UP WITHOUT KNOWING THEIR FATHERS, SOMETHING WITH<br>SERIOUS MENTAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES ON<br>CHILD DEVELOPMENT<br>6) THE SHOCKING BRUTALITIES COMMITTED ON THE<br>OVAHERERO PRISONERS OF WAR, THE DEGRADING AND<br>INHUMANE CONDITIONS OF THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS TO<br>WHICH THEY WERE SUBJECTED. OUR PEOPLE WERE EXPOSED<br>7<br>TO STARVATION PRIOR TO PUBLIC EXECUTIONS.<br>7) THE MASS IMPOVERISHMENT AND HUMILIATION OF AN<br>OTHERWISE WEALTHY, SELF-SUFFICIENT AND PROUD AFRICAN<br>NATION.<br>8) THE ABOVE CONSTITUTES A SOLID MORAL AND LEGAL<br>INDICTMENT AGAINST COLLECTIVE CONSCIENCE OF THE<br>GERMAN PEOPLE. IT IS ALSO CONSTITUTES A GROSS<br>VIOLATION OF THE PUBLIC POLICY AND MORALITY OF THE<br>GERMAN STATE AS PRESENTLY CONSTITUTED.<br>9) HON. SPEAKER, MY PEOPLE REJECTED THE POOR ATTEMPT<br>BY THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT TO HIDE BEHIND DISCREDITED<br>LEGALISTIC ARGUMENT AS A BASIS FOR DENYING THE<br>REPARATION DEMAND OF THE OVAHERERO, WHILST AT THE<br>SAME TIME SEEKING TO JUSTIFY IT’S PAYMENT OF<br>REPARATION TO THE JEWS FOR SIMILAR CRIMES COMMITTED<br>BY THE HITLER REGIME. SUCH AN ATTITUDE ON THE PART OF<br>THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT IS NOTHING BUT A NAKED ACT OF<br>RACISM AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE IN GENERAL AND THE<br>OVAHERERO IN PARTICULAR. IT IS ALSO AN INSULT TO THE<br>COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE OF MANKIND EVERYWHERE.<br>UNLESS OUR REASONABLE PROPOSALS TO RESOLVE THIS<br>MATTER ARE PUT ON THE AGENDA OF VARIOUS ORGANS OF<br>THE UNITED NATIONS FOR PUBLIC DEBATE AND<br>ADJUDICATION, THE STRUGGLE WILL GO ON. ON 30TH<br>OCTOBER DURING THE CENTENNIAL COMMEMORATION AT<br>OZOMBU ZOVINDIMBA THE OVAHERERO LAUNCHED THE<br>“OZOMBU ZOVINDIMBA DECLARATION” WHEN THEY MADE A<br>PROMISED TO THEMSELVES THAT ALUTA CONTINUA UNTIL<br>JUSTICE HAS BEEN DONE.<br>10) I BELIEVE THAT SIGNIFICANT PARTS OF THE<br>GENEVA CONVETIONS AND OTHER SIMILAR TREATIES OF THE<br>LATE 1940’s WERE MERELY CODIFICATION OF PRE-EXISTING<br>INTERNATIONAL LEGAL PRINCIPLES GOVERING “UNJUST<br>WARS” AND THE CONSEQUENCES THEREOF. IT WAS SIMILAR<br>PRE-EXISTING LEGAL PRINCIPLES WHICH FORMED THE BASIS<br>OF PRESENT DAY RULES ON “WAR CRIMES”. “CRIMES AGAINST<br>PEACE AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY” – THEY ALL INCLUDE<br>8<br>THE GENOCIDE CONVENTION OF 1948.<br>HON. SPEAKER, HON. MEMBERS, THE DEMAND OF OUR PEOPLE<br>FOR REPARATION IS NOT AN ISOLATED AND UNREASONABLE,<br>LET ME TAKE YOU DOWN THROUGH MEMORY LINE.<br>Ø 1990 AUSTRIA PAID $25 MILLION TO HOLOCAUST<br>SURVIVORS JEWISH CLAIM ON AUSTRALIA<br>Ø 1990 THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PAID $1,2 BILLION OR<br>20,000 TO EACH JAPANESE AMERICAN<br>Ø 1985 U.S.A PAID $105 MILLION SIOUX OF SOUTH DAKOTA<br>Ø 1985 U.S.A PAID $12,3 MILLION TO SEMINOLES OF FLORIDA<br>Ø 1985 U.S.A PAID $ MILLIONS TO CHIPPEWAS OF WISCONSIN<br>Ø 1988 CANADA PAID $230 MILLION TO JAPANS CANADIANS<br>Ø 1988 CANADA RETURN 250,000 SQ MILES OF LAND TO<br>INDIANS AND ESKIMOS<br>Ø 1988-1999 INDIAN GAMING REGULATORY ACT MAKING<br>BILLIONS FOR THE AMERICAN INDIANS<br>Ø 1980 U.S.A PAID $81 MILLION KLAMATHS OF OREGON<br>Ø 1971 U.S.A PAID $ 1 BILLION AND 44 MILLION ACRES OF<br>LAND TO ALASKA NATIVES LAND SETTLEMENT<br>Ø 1952 GERMANY PAID $822 MILLION TO HOLOCAUST<br>SURVIVORS GERMAN JEWISH SETTLEMENT.<br>HON. SPEAKER, SIR, OUR DEMAND FOR REPARATION IS IN LINE<br>WITH INTERNATIONAL DEMAND, THEREFORE, IT NEEDS OUR<br>COLLECTIVE AND PATRIOTIC SUPPORT AS A NATION.<br>HON. SPEAKER, HON. MEMBERS, ON A VISIT TO NAMIBIA IN<br>MARCH 1998, THE GERMAN PRESIDENT H.E. PRESIDENT ROMAN<br>HERTZOG DID NOT DENY THAT GERMANY HAS COMMITTED<br>ATROCITIES AGAINST OUR PEOPLE AND OVAHERERO IN<br>PARTICULAR AS MUCH AS HE ADMITTED, HE WENT ON AND<br>SAID THAT TOO MUCH TIME HAD PASSED FOR GERMANY TO<br>GIVE ANY FORMAL APOLOGY FOR SLAUGHTERING OVAHERERO<br>DURING COLONIAL RULES. HE ALSO ADMITTED THAT GERMAN<br>SOLDIERS HAD ACTED INCORRECTLY BETWEEN 1904-8 WHEN<br>ABOUT 85000 MEMBERS OF THE OVAHERERO PEOPLE WERE<br>KILLED FOR OPPOSING COLONIALISM.<br>9<br>BUT ON 14TH AUGUST 2004 DURING THE CENTENNIAL<br>COMMEMORATION AT OHAMAKARI, THE GERMAN<br>PARLIAMENTARIAN AND MINISTER OF ECONOMIC<br>COOPERATION HON. HEIDEMARIE WIECZORECK – ZEUL SAID IN<br>HER SPEECH THAT “THE ATROCITIES COMMITTED AT THE TIME<br>WOULD TO DAY BE TERMED GENOCIDE AND NOWADAYS GERMAN<br>COLONIAL TROOPS UNDER GENERAL LOTHAR VON THROTHA<br>WOULD BE PROSECUTE AND CONVICTED”.<br>HON. SPEAKER HON. MEMBERS, THE HON. MINISTER WENT ON<br>AND PLEADED FOR FORGIVENESS AND SAID “WE GERMANS<br>ACCEPTED OUR HISTORICAL AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND<br>THE INJURY INCURRED BY GERMAN AT THE TIME. AND SO IN THE<br>WORDS OF THE LORDS PRAYER, I ASK YOU TO FORGIVE US FOR<br>OUR TRESS PASSES”<br>WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS PROCESS OF REMAINING AND<br>WITHOUT SORROW THERE CAN BE NO TRUE<br>RECONCILIATION,REMEMBRANCE IS THE KEY TO<br>RECONCILIATION SHE SAID, REACTING TO THE GERMAN<br>MINISTER APOLOGY THE NAMIBIAN MINISTER OF LANDS,<br>RESETTLEMENT AND REHABILITATION THEN HIFIKEPUNYE<br>POHAMBA URGED THE CROWD PRESENT AT THE EVENT TO<br>ACCEPT THE GERMAN MINISTER’S APOLOGY AND HE SAID “LET<br>US ACCEPT THIS APOLOGY AS NAMIBIANS. HE STRESSED THAT<br>NAMIBIAN MUST ACCEPT GERMANY’S APOLOGY AND LOOK TO THE<br>FUTURE”<br>HON. SPEAKER, THE NAMIBIANS HAS ACCEPTED GERMANY’S<br>APOLOGY AND THEY ARE KNOW CALLING UPON GERMANY TO<br>SIT AROUND THE TABLE WITH US AND TO WORK OUT THE<br>FUTURE TOGETHER, THIS IS OUR DEMAND.<br>HON, SPEAKER, HON MEMBERS THE GERMAN PRESIDENT ALSO<br>STATED THAT GERMANY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY ASSISTED<br>NAMIBIA FOR YEARS AND HE PLEDGED UNILATERALLY THAT<br>GERMANY WOULD LIVE UP TO ITS SPECIAL HISTORICAL<br>RESPONSIBILITY TOWARD NAMIBIA.<br>10<br>THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT SHOULD REALIZE THAT THE<br>NAMIBIANS THROUGH THEIR LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT HAS<br>THE RIGHT TO DECIDE FOR THEM, IT IS THEREFORE,<br>CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT<br>COME TO TERMS WITH REALITY AND STOP UNDER ESTIMATING<br>THE COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE OF THE AFRICAN PEOPLE IN<br>GENERAL AND THE NAMIBIANS IN PARTICULAR.<br>LET US, AS ELECTED A REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR PEOPLE,<br>COLLECTIVELY ADVICE THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT TO<br>CONVENE A CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE IN ORDER TO SET UP<br>AN AGENDA FOR DIALOGUE THAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY<br>TO SOLVE UNRESOLVED ISSUE.<br>HON. SPEAKER, HON. MEMBERS IN 1998, RESPONDING CLAIMS<br>BY THE OVAHERERO LEADERS AND THE REASONS WHY<br>NAMIBIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT SUPPORT THEIR DEMAND<br>FOR REPARATION THE RIGHT HON. PRIME MINISTER BY THEN<br>HON. HAGE GEINGOB, SAID THAT “IT WAS WRONG FOR THE<br>OVAHERERO TO DEMAND REPARATION FOR THE OVAHERERO<br>ALONE, AS THEY WERE NOT THE ONLY ONE, WHO WERE<br>AFFECTED BY THE GERMAN ATTROCITIES AND THAT ALL<br>NAMIBIANS SUFFERED”.<br>I AM NOW PRESENTING THIS MOTION TO THIS AUGUST HOUSE,<br>THE NAMIBIAN PARLIAMENT FOR DISCUSSION, DEBATE AND<br>FOR YOUR PATRIOTIC SUPPORT.<br>HON. SPEAKER, SIR, ALLOW ME TO CONCLUDE BY MENTIONING<br>WHAT EXTERMINATION PROCLAMATION MEAN IN CONCRETE<br>TERMS, LET ME QUOTE FROM THE WITNESS ACCOUNT OF A<br>GERMAN SOLDIER WHO PURSUED THE OVAHERERO THROUGH<br>SANDVELD (OMAHEKE) TO BOTSWANA “THROUGH THE QUIET<br>NIGHT WE HEARD, IN THE DISTANCE, THE LOWING OF ENORMOUS<br>HERD OF THIRSTY CATTLE, AND A DULL CONFUSED SOUND LIKE<br>THE MOVEMENT OF A WHOLE PEOPLE TO THE EAST THERE WAS A<br>ATLANTICS GROW OF FIRE, AND ENEMY HAD FLED TO THE EAST<br>WITH THEIR WHOLE ENORMOUS MASS WOMEN, CHILDREN AND<br>HERD<br>11<br>THE NEXT MORNING WE VENTURED TO PURSUE THE ENEMY.<br>THE GROUND WAS TRODDEN WON INTO A FLOOR FOR A WIDTH<br>OF ABOUT 100 YARDS, FOR IN SUCH A BROAD THICK HORDE<br>HAD THE ENEMY AND THEIR CATTLE STORMED ALONG.

1034	\N	1001	2008-10-09	\N	\N	Joint Motion for a Resolution on Kenyan Elections	13	\N	European Parliament resolution on Kenya<br>The European Parliament,<br>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having regard to the Preliminary Statement of the European Union Election Observation Mission (EUEOM) in Kenya of 1 January 2008,<br>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having regard to the Declaration by the Presidency of the European Union on behalf of the European Union concerning Presidential Elections in Kenya of 8 January 2008,<br>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having regard to the African Charter of Human and Peoples’ Rights guidelines on the conduct of democratic elections,<br>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having regard to the African Union Declaration on the Principles Governing Democratic Elections in Africa (2002),<br>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having regard to the Declaration of Principles for International Election Observation and the Code of Conduct for International Election Observers, commemorated at the United Nations on 27 October 2005,<br>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having regard to the Partnership Agreement between the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000 (the ‘Cotonou Agreement’) and amended in Luxembourg on 25 June 2005, in particular Articles 8 and 9 thereof,<br>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having regard to Rule 103(4) of its Rules of Procedure,<br>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas presidential and legislative elections were held in Kenya on 27 December 2007, in which nine parties fielded presidential candidates, including President Kibaki from the Party of National Unity (PNU) and Ralia Odinga for the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM),<br>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas the two major parties, Mr Odinga’s Orange Democratic Movement and Mr Kibaki’s Party of National Unity, won, respectively, 99 and 43 seats out of 210 in the national parliament,<br>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas the 2007 presidential elections in Kenya fell short of basic international and regional standards for democratic elections and were followed by rioting that led to the death of over 600 people,<br>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas the political violence led to the displacement of 250 000 people and affected between 400 000 and 500 000 Kenyans, specifically from the cities of Eldoret, Kericho and Kisumu, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OGHA),<br>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas the current political crisis had its genesis mainly in the previous National Rainbow Coalition (NARC), which won the 2000 election, when Mr Kibaki and Odinga agreed to share power, an agreement which was not honoured,<br>F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas the recommendations made by the 2002 EU EOM were not taken sufficiently into consideration, including those on the size and boundaries of the constituencies for the general elections and the recommendation that the tenure of office of the ECK Commissioners should run to six months after general elections, in order to enhance the independence and professionalism of the election authority, <br>G.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; noting that the 2007 campaign atmosphere was characterised by a strong political polarisation between the Kibaki and Odinga camps, which led to a tense atmosphere in their respective ethnic communities,<br>H.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas the presidential elections have betrayed the hopes and expectations of the Kenyan people, who eagerly engaged in the electoral process by voting in large numbers in a peaceful and patient manner,<br>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas intense diplomatic efforts, including the mediating mission of the African Union chairman, John Kufuor, and efforts made by four former presidents have failed to resolve the political crisis,<br>J.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas on 8 January Mwai Kibaki unilaterally appointed 17 members of his cabinet, before the international mediation had run its course, thus effectively pre-empting a tripartite negotiation and prompting the ODM to resume mass protests,<br>K.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas during the election campaign freedom of association, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly were broadly respected; whereas, however, the campaign was also marked by ethno-political divisions, which contributed to the volatile situation in the run-up to the elections,<br>L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas the international community did not pay sufficient attention to these underlying ethnic tensions and must henceforth take this issue into consideration in any future mediation efforts in the current Kenyan crisis,<br>M.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas the Election Commission of Kenya (ECK) oversaw the logistical and technical aspect of the elections, improved access to voter registration centres and trained the polling staff,<br>N.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas, however, the ECK did not demonstrate the impartiality, transparency and confidentiality that are prerequisites in a democratic election, and whereas this is reflected in the flawed procedures for appointing ECK Commissioners,<br>O.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas the EU EOM observers were welcomed by the relevant authorities at polling stations, where polling was conducted in an orderly manner,<br>P.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas, however, the EU EOM observers were not given similar access to tallying stations and concluded that the lack of transparency and adequate security procedures severely undermined the credibility of the presidential election results,<br>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas turnouts higher than 90% were recorded at certain polling stations and whereas the ECK voiced doubts about these unrealistically high figures,<br>R.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas the EU EOM concluded that, overall, the election process prior to tabulation was well managed and that the parliamentary elections were deemed largely successful,<br>S.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas, however, the EU EOM concluded that the tallying process in the presidential election lacked credibility and therefore expressed doubts as to the accuracy of the results,<br>T.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas, according to the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, threats have been made against members of the Kenyans for Peace with Truth and Justice Initiative (KPTJ), a coalition of independent NGOs which was formed in the aftermath of the elections to denounce electoral fraud and to support freedom of expression and association in the country, <br>U.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whereas Kenya has made commitments to respect for fundamental civil rights, democracy based on the rule of law and transparent and accountable governance within the framework of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement (Cotonou Agreement),<br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Condemns the tragic loss of life and critical humanitarian situation, and calls urgently on the relevant authorities and stakeholders to do their utmost to bring peace to the Republic of Kenya and to ensure that human rights and the rule of law are respected;<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Endorses the conclusions presented by the EU EOM in its Preliminary Statement;<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regrets that, despite the broadly successful parliamentary elections, the results of the presidential elections cannot be considered credible owing to widespread reports of electoral irregularities;<br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deplores the fact that the incumbent, Mwai Kibaki, appointed his cabinet unilaterally, which severely undermined mediation efforts;<br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calls on the incumbent, Mwai Kibaki, to respect his country’s democratic commitments as enshrined in the country’s National Constitution and the guidelines of the African Charter of Human and People’s Rights relating to free and fair elections and to agree to an independent examination of the presidential vote; urges the Kenyan authorities, in addition, to facilitate this investigation in order to redress the situation and make the perpetrators of these irregularities accountable for their actions;<br>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Urges the Kenyan authorities to guarantee in all circumstances the physical and psychological integrity of KPTJ members and all human rights defenders in the country and to put an end to all acts harassment directed against human rights defenders in Kenya;<br>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calls on both sides to engage urgently in tangible remedial action through negotiation; supports, in this regard, further mediation efforts by a panel of African elders led by Kofi Annan, the former United Nations Secretary-General;<br>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calls on the Presidency of the European Union and the European Commission to monitor closely the mediation mission led by Mr Annan and, if required, to ensure an immediate continuation of these mediation efforts by a high-level European Union delegation, possibly in a joint EU-AU initiative; calls on the European Commission to offer to the Kenyan authorities all necessary technical and financial assistance in the process of the independent examination of the presidential elections, as well as in the steps deemed necessary to redress the situation;<br>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calls for concrete measures to establish a truly impartial Election Commission which will be better able to conduct free and fair elections in future;<br>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Draws attention to the statement by Samuel Kivuitu, head of the Kenyan Election Commission, who has disowned the presidential election results published in the media and called for an independent inquiry into the allegations of fraud;<br>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calls for fresh presidential elections should it prove impossible to organise a credible and fair recount of the votes in the presidential election by an independent body;<br>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regrets that the opportunity provided by the 2007 presidential elections to consolidate and further develop the electoral and wider democratic process was missed;<br>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calls on the leadership of the political parties to take responsibility for preventing further violence in the country, to demonstrate a commitment to the rule of law and to guarantee respect for human rights;<br>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is deeply preoccupied by the social repercussions of the current economic crisis, its detrimental effect on the country’s socio-economic development and the economic consequences for neighbouring countries, which depend to a large extent on Kenya’s infrastructures and whose humanitarian situation is being undermined by this crisis;<br>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Strongly condemns the killing of 10 African Union peacekeepers in Darfur, and<br>considers this a war crime to be promptly investigated by the United Nations and the<br>African Union;<br>2. Demands an immediate cessation of hostilities and attacks on AMIS, civilians and<br>humanitarian agencies, their staff and assets and relief convoys;<br>3. Considers that the Sudanese government and the rebel groups should cooperate fully<br>with an independent investigation into the dreadful attack in Haskanita;<br>4. Stresses that customary laws of war and the statute of the International Criminal Court<br>prohibit directing attacks against personnel and objects involved in international<br>peacekeeping missions, so long as they are not directly involved in hostilities;<br>5. Reminds the Government of Sudan that it bears the prime responsibility for internal<br>security and action from the international community should not be taken as a pretext<br>for abdicating this responsibility;<br>6. Welcomes the acceptance by the Government of Sudan (GoS) on 12 June 2007 of the<br>AU/UN hybrid force, recalling however that the GoS has made previous unfulfilled<br>commitments to allow the hybrid force into Sudan; calls, for a rapid deployment of<br>the AU/UN hybrid force with a mandate which enables it to efficiently protect<br>civilians;<br>7. Calls on the international community to fulfil its commitment as enough troops have<br>been promised; notes that Western nations are not rushing in with military hardware;<br>8. Calls on the EU and other international donors to urgently provide additional support<br>to AMIS under its present structure, including long-term funding commitments as<br>well as much needed technical support for a transitional period until the hybrid force<br>is completely implemented;<br>9. Reiterates its deep concern for the security of humanitarian aid workers and their<br>access to populations in need;<br>10. Reiterates its belief in the basis provided by the Darfur Peace Agreement and calls on<br>the EU, the UN and the African Union to show a united front in efforts to resolve the<br>conflict in Darfur and to prioritise a comprehensive peace process;<br>11. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Heads of<br>State and Government of the EU Member States, the Government and Parliament of<br>Sudan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Heads of State and<br>Government of the Arab League, the Governments of the ACP countries, the ACP-EU<br>Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the Institutions of the African Union	\N	\N	\N	t	draft motion

whereas 170 million children are undernourished<br>and 5.6 million children die each year as a result of malnutrition,<br>D. whereas the current food crisis is also the consequence of increased speculation in<br>agricultural and food commodities,<br>E. whereas, according to the FAO, food represents 60-80% of consumer spending in developing<br>countries and about 10-20% in industrialised nations; whereas the rise in food prices impacts<br>most heavily on low-income households,<br>F. whereas the price rises are exacerbating problems of accessibility, particularly for those on<br>low or non-existent incomes,<br>G. whereas demand for food is rising, especially in emerging countries such as China and India,<br>as the world’s population increases; recalling that the planet, which according to the FAO<br>can feed 12 billion people, is not short of food in overall terms; recalling that the wheat<br>harvest and the rice harvest were very good in 2007; whereas only 1 01 billion tonnes of the<br>2007 harvest is likely to be used to feed people, while a large proportion will be used to feed<br>animals (760 million tonnes) and some 100 million tonnes to produce agrofuels; whereas the<br>latest estimates suggest that world cereal production should increase in 2008 by 2.6% to a<br>record 2 164 million tonnes; whereas, however, these estimates are dependent on favourable<br>climatic conditions,<br>H. whereas many developing countries are not realising their food production potential; whereas<br>lack of investment in agriculture, rural development and training of farmers in developing<br>countries and by international financial institutions have exposed small farmers in particular<br>to unfair competition, which has increased their poverty and vulnerability and decreased their<br>capacity to produce enough food,<br>I. whereas one serious obstacle to increased agricultural output in developing countries is that<br>small farmers often lack access to loans or microcredits for investment in improved seeds,<br>fertilisers and irrigation mechanisms and the necessary range of crop protection tools to<br>protect their harvests from pests and diseases, sometimes owing to the fact that they do not<br>own their land and therefore do not have any collateral for loans,<br>J. whereas the World Food Programme has indicated that only 260 million of the 750 million<br>US dollars needed to cover 2008 requirements have so far been firmly pledged,<br>K. whereas rising food prices are intensifying the need for an integrated political response and a<br>comprehensive strategy to tackle food problems,<br>The right to food<br>RC\\724413EN.doc PE401.540v01-00}<br>PE401.549v01-00}<br>PE401.551v01-00}<br>PE401.558v01-00}<br>PE401.562v01-00}<br>PE401.565v01-00} RC1<br>EN<br>1. Stresses the fundamental nature of the right to food and the need to improve access for all<br>people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life; underlines that States have the<br>obligation to protect, respect and fulfil this fundamental human right; points out that the fact<br>that 2 billion people still live in dire poverty and 850 million human beings are hungry daily<br>demonstrates systematic violations of the right to food, as enshrined in international human<br>rights law; calls therefore for adequate measures to implement the provisions of the<br>Universal Declaration of Human Rights on the right to food; urges the Council to ensure<br>coherence of all food-related national and international policies with obligations under the<br>right to food;<br>2. Calls on the Council, therefore, to step up its commitments to the Millennium Development<br>Goals by reaffirming funding commitments and adopting an EU MDG Agenda for Action at<br>the June European Council; considers that this EU Agenda for Action should identify<br>specific milestones and actions within timeframes in key areas such as education, health,<br>water, agriculture, growth and infrastructure that will contribute to ensuring the achievement<br>of the MDGs by 2015 with a view, among other objectives, to eradicating hunger by 2015;<br>3. Is concerned by the effects of speculation in food commodities, including commodity hedge<br>funds, on hunger and poverty; invites the Commission to analyse the effect of speculation on<br>food prices and to come up with appropriate measures on the basis of this analysis;<br>4. Recalls that those suffering the most from this crisis are the less-favoured layers of the<br>population and therefore stresses the need for appropriate social policies to empower poor or<br>deprived populations and mitigate the effects of the current food crisis;<br>Sustainable food production<br>5. Emphasises that the supply of food to all people across the globe should take precedence<br>over any other goal; stresses that food should be available at reasonable prices, as stated in<br>Article 33 of the EC Treaty;<br>6. Recalls the need to ensure internal and global regulation of agricultural markets in the<br>interest of consumers, farmers’ incomes, the processing industries and a sustainable EU food<br>policy;<br>7. Emphasises that the raw material cost is a relatively minor component in the total cost of<br>many food products; calls on the Commission and the Member States to analyse the<br>discrepancies between farmgate prices and those charged by the major retailers;<br>8. Calls, therefore, for an impact assessment of the role of retailers in the food chain, as retail<br>food prices have risen disproportionately compared with the cost of living; calls on retailers<br>to pass on a fair price to producers, while at the same time providing consumers with<br>reasonably priced food;<br>9. Points out that current EU cereal stocks would last only 30 days, and questions whether our<br>food stocks are at the right level, especially in view of possible crises; asks the Commission<br>RC\\724413EN.doc PE401.540v01-00}<br>PE401.549v01-00}<br>PE401.551v01-00}<br>PE401.558v01-00}<br>PE401.562v01-00}<br>PE401.565v01-00} RC1<br>EN<br>to develop strategies to set up food stocks to prevent future crises;<br>10. Calls for better forecasting of agricultural output so as to be able to identify prevailing trends<br>in world food supply much earlier;<br>11. Demands that the promotion of sustainable agricultural policies be included in all<br>enlargement and neighbourhood instruments;<br>12. Stresses that priority needs to be given to food over fuels, and that biofuel production should<br>be linked to strong sustainability criteria; notes that in achieving the proposed biofuels target<br>these criteria must be met;<br>Better development policies<br>13. Considers that a genuine fight against hunger requires a global sustainable development<br>policy in order to enable developing countries to produce and supply their population with<br>sufficient water and food;<br>14. Supports developing countries in their endeavours to secure access to food for their local<br>populations; believes that viable policy space must be further strengthened to allow for<br>national rules and measures for the development of this sector; considers Malawi to be a<br>positive example of a developing country where food production has been doubled in the last<br>three years, and underlines that the EU is playing a role in supporting this development; calls<br>on the European Union to provide assistance with making this phenomenon known, so that it<br>can be taken as an example in other developing countries;<br>15. Calls on the EU Member States and the international community to meet the extraordinary<br>emergency appeal of the World Food Programme as a matter of urgency and to assist it in<br>facing up to the new challenges in the fight against hunger; considers, nevertheless, that<br>dependence on food aid operations needs to be reduced, and stresses, therefore, the need for<br>mid- and long-term action to prevent more damaging consequences and to tackle the root<br>causes of this crisis;<br>16. Calls for an urgent and substantial increase in investment in agriculture, aquaculture, rural<br>development and agribusinesses in developing countries, focused on poor farmers and<br>small-scale farming based on agro-ecological food production systems; recalls that 75% of<br>the world’s poor population lives in rural areas, but that only 4% of official development<br>assistance (ODA) is dedicated to agriculture; calls, therefore, on the Commission and the<br>Member States to address the issue of agriculture more effectively in their development<br>policies, to promote the adjustment of the programming of the 10th EDF in close cooperation<br>with developing countries and to readdress the country strategy papers in order to give higher<br>priority to agriculture; underlines the role of NGOs and local authorities in finding innovative<br>agricultural solutions in partnership with the populations of developing countries, and calls<br>on the Commission and the Member States to support and promote their projects;<br>17. Stresses the need to give small farmers in poor countries, who are mainly women, access to<br>land, financial services and credit, high-yield seeds, irrigation systems and fertilisers; stresses<br>RC\\724413EN.doc PE401.540v01-00}<br>PE401.549v01-00}<br>PE401.551v01-00}<br>PE401.558v01-00}<br>PE401.562v01-00}<br>PE401.565v01-00} RC1<br>EN<br>that investment in the agricultural sector needs to focus more on irrigation, rural roads,<br>research and local knowledge, training and exchange of best practice with a view to<br>developing sustainable, efficient crop systems, clean drinking water and education, as well as<br>on enhancing local production and market exchanges; calls on the Commission, therefore, to<br>reinforce these areas in its actions and to support producer organisations, microcredit and<br>other financial service programmes and increased investment in agriculture;<br>18. Calls on the EIB to investigate possibilities for the immediate setting up of a guarantee fund<br>in support of national microcredit and loan schemes and risk-hedging schemes that operate<br>close to the needs of local food producers, especially in poorer developing countries;<br>19. Stresses the need for cooperation on climate change between the EU and the developing<br>countries, particularly the need for technology transfer and capacity building; emphasises that<br>climate change must be mainstreamed into all EU development cooperation, underlines that<br>some simple safeguards would help farmers protect crops from droughts and other disasters,<br>and calls on the Commission to explore them; calls on the international community to<br>intensify its efforts to combat desertification, land degradation and drought so as to improve<br>food security and access to water, especially in poor countries;<br>Fair international trade<br>20. Considers that the opening up of agricultural markets needs to be progressive, in accordance<br>with the development progress of each individual developing country and based on socially<br>fair and environmentally sound trade rules; notes that sensitive products that are basic needs<br>for people in the developing countries or of particular importance to food security and rural<br>development in developing countries should be excluded from full liberalisation in order to<br>prevent irreversible damages to local producers; stresses that the EU must promote a<br>preferential and asymmetric system in trade negotiations with developing countries in order<br>to allow them to keep certain supply-management and other development tools in their<br>markets; points out that the least-developed countries have quota- and tariff-free market<br>access to the EU, under the ´Everything But Arms’ (EBA) agreement;<br>21. Stresses that, in current Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) negotiations, the<br>Commission’s priority must be to respond to the development needs expressed by ACP<br>countries; recalls that, in order to meet this challenge, EPAs must be accompanied by the<br>promised new funding for Aid for Trade (€2bn a year by 2010) and by the promotion of<br>regional integration;<br>22. Stresses the need for a successful, balanced and fair outcome of the Doha Development<br>Round; stresses that the results of the Doha Round should give positive incentives to the<br>developing countries to invest in their agriculture and food production; invites the<br>Commission to support proposals to include an action on staple food prices in the current<br>WTO negotiation round;<br>23. Renews its call on the Commission and the Council to promote Fair Trade and other ethical<br>schemes that contribute to raising social and environmental standards by supporting small<br>RC\\724413EN.doc PE401.540v01-00}<br>PE401.549v01-00}<br>PE401.551v01-00}<br>PE401.558v01-00}<br>PE401.562v01-00}<br>PE401.565v01-00} RC1<br>EN<br>and marginalised producers in developing countries, decreasing volatility and guaranteeing<br>fairer prices and income, and encourages public authorities in the European Union to<br>integrate Fair Trade and sustainability criteria into their public tenders and purchasing<br>policies;<br>Promotion of democracy<br>24. Underlines that the current food crisis demonstrates the need to promote political stability,<br>regional integration, democracy and human rights, not only within the EU, but also<br>worldwide; calls, therefore, on all relevant stakeholders to promote human and democratic<br>values and the rule of the law when addressing the current food crisis and tackling long-term<br>food security problems;<br>25. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the<br>governments and parliaments of the Member States, the World Bank, the G8, the United<br>Nations Secretary-General and the United Nations General Assembly, the Co-Presidents of<br>the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the Pan-African Parliament (PAP).	\N	\N	\N	t	Motion scheduled
